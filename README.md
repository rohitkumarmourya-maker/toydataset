# toyDB-Optimization

This repository contains an educational toy DBMS consisting of three storage and indexing layers:

1. **PF Layer** – Paged File Manager + Buffer Manager  
2. **Slotted Page Layer** – Implemented using `spage.c` and `spage.h`  
3. **AM Layer** – B+ Tree Secondary Index

Additionally, the repository includes experiments for all three layers:

- PF Experiment → `pf_results.csv`
- Slotted Page Experiment → `slotted_results.csv`
- Bulk Index Build → `index_bulk_results.csv`
- Incremental Index Build → `index_incremental_results.csv`
